# Ask important questions when you're just starting to build something

## What HTML do I need?

- 3x3 grid
  - `div`? `button`? `table`?
- New game `button`
- A header to announce the winner
- A section to keep track of the current winner

## What CSS do I need?

- `display`/`position`
  - grid and sidebar on the same line
  - 3 grids on one line at all times (`row` and `col` if using Bootstrap)
- `border`
  - `1px solid black` (Mei's favourite)?
- `font-family` and colour properties (e.g, `color`, `background-color`, `border-color`)
- `padding` and `margin`

  - space between border of the grid and the marker

- Responsiveness:
  - `calc( )`
  - `vw` and `vh` for responsive width and height
  - media queries
